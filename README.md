# Terminal Portfolio

## About The Repo
A terminal portfolio made from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Javascript - No libraries! \
The entire idea to make something like this came from [DonDoesStuff](https://github.com/DonDoesStuff), please make sure to check them out as this entire project wouldn't exist if it weren't for them.
